You are competing against a computer. The game has two levels. The first level is about guessing a number between 1 and 100. The program will tell you if the right number is lower, higher or you have guessed it! If you want to move to the next level you can simply do so! The hard part is that you have only 10 tries to guess the number.

# Input and Output
First level: choose a number between 1 and 100 and press Enter. The program will then navigate you through the game.
Second level: choose a number between 1 and 200 and press Enter.
